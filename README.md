# Semantic Segmentation Dashboard
Repository to hold, test and compare state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. In this repository we are going to be comparing these models on different parameters and using different datasets. The main motive of this repository is to finalize on a segmentation model to use for our Ice Segmentation Task.

## Problem Statement
We are trying to deploy a web application running on streamlit to explore different versions of DeepLab v3 Architecture and more such segmentation architectures to explore the performance and live inference of the models.

## Steps of Deployment
