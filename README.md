# semantic_segmentation
Repository to hold, test and compare state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. In this repository we are going to be comparing these models on different parameters and using different datasets. The main motive of this repository is to finalize on a segmentation model to use for our Ice Segmentation Task.
